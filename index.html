Need to build a website, android and ios app, for namaz prayer times. which will autodetect location and or allow user to choose the mosque and view the prayer times. it should have 3 user access, 1 the end user who will be able to view the prayer timing, select the mosque and view live broadcast from the selected mosque, or master broadcast. 2. the mosque admin who can modify the timing and broadcast from the mosque.
3. master admins, who can add, delete, modify mosque details
BLACKBOXAI

Since you're requesting a comprehensive solution across web, Android, and iOS platforms, I'll start by creating a web version that will serve as the foundation for all platforms. We'll use a responsive design approach that will also facilitate conversion to mobile apps later.

Here's a complete single-file solution for the web version with:

    Location detection
    Mosque selection
    Prayer time display
    Three user types with appropriate UI controls
    Broadcast viewing capability
    Admin interfaces for mosque and master admins

I'll implement this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling:

Developed a Comprehensive Prayer Timings App & Web Platform
dynamologic

For deploying a website and mobile app for prayer times, consider platforms like PrayerMate, which offers a user-friendly interface for prayer management, and Muslim Pro, known for its extensive features including prayer times and Qibla direction. Additionally, ConnectMazjid provides tools for mosque administrators to manage prayer times and broadcasts effectively.

help me build website
BLACKBOXAI

I'll help you build a comprehensive prayer times website with all the features you requested. Let's create a complete solution with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file that includes:

    Location detection
    Mosque selection
    Prayer time display
    Three user types (end user, mosque admin, master admin)
    Live broadcast viewing
    Admin interfaces

Here's the complete code:

html863 lines
Click to expand

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
...

This complete solution includes:

    User Authentication System with three roles:
        End User (can view prayer times and broadcasts)
        Mosque Admin (can update prayer times and manage broadcasts)
        Master Admin (can manage all mosques and admins)

    Core Features:
        Mosque selection interface
        Prayer time display with active prayer highlighting
        Live broadcast viewing capability
        Location detection functionality

    Admin Interfaces:
        Mosque Admin Dashboard:
            Prayer time management
            Broadcast controls
            Mosque information updates
        Master Admin Dashboard:
            Mosque management (add/edit/delete)
            Admin user management

    Responsive Design:
        Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
        Clean, intuitive interface with Islamic design elements

    Interactive Elements:
        Prayer time cards that show details when clicked
        Mosque selection with visual feedback
        Broadcast player with fullscreen mode

To deploy this website:

    Save the code as index.html
    Upload it to any web hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
    For production, you would need to:
        Add backend functionality (Node.js, PHP, etc.)
        Connect to a database for prayer times and mosque data
        Implement real broadcast streaming (using services like YouTube Live or Wowza)
        Add proper authentication system

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this implementation in more detail?

where can I host this for free
BLACKBOXAI

You can host your website for free on several platforms. Here are some popular options:

    GitHub Pages:
        Ideal for static websites.
        You can create a repository, push your HTML file, and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
        URL format: https://username.github.io/repository-name

    Netlify:
        Supports static sites and offers continuous deployment from Git repositories.
        You can drag and drop your HTML file or connect your GitHub repository.
        URL format: https://your-site-name.netlify.app

    Vercel:
        Great for static sites and serverless functions.
        You can deploy directly from a GitHub repository or upload your files.
        URL format: https://your-site-name.vercel.app

    Glitch:
        Allows you to create and host web applications easily.
        You can edit your code directly in the browser and see changes in real-time.
        URL format: https://your-project-name.glitch.me

    Replit:
        An online IDE that allows you to host web applications.
        You can create a new Repl, paste your HTML code, and run it.
        URL format: https://your-repl-name.repl.co

    Surge:
        A simple command-line tool for publishing static sites.
        You can install Surge via npm and deploy your site with a single command.
        URL format: https://your-site-name.surge.sh

Steps to Host on GitHub Pages:

    Create a GitHub Account: If you don't have one, sign up at GitHub.

    Create a New Repository:
        Go to your GitHub profile and click on "New" to create a new repository.
        Name your repository (e.g., namaz-prayer-times).
        Choose "Public" and click "Create repository".

    Upload Your HTML File:
        Click on "Add file" > "Upload files".
        Drag and drop your index.html file or click to select it.
        Commit the changes.

    Enable GitHub Pages:
        Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
        Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
        Under "Source", select the branch (usually main or master) and click "Save".

    Access Your Site:
        After a few minutes, your site will be available at https://username.github.io/namaz-prayer-times.

Conclusion

Choose the platform that best fits your needs. For a simple static site, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel are excellent choices. If you need more interactive features or backend support, consider Glitch or Replit.
